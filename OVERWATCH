0. Warnings

Overwatch requires a graphics card with drivers that can support the latest OpenGL extensions. If you
don't see the following line in glxinfo, you may have a hard time:

"OpenGL shading language version string: 4.50"

Overwatch tries to detect cheaters. Blizzard may decide that running Overwatch under wine is verboten
and ban you; you have been warned.

There is a good chance that when Overwatch is updated, it will stop working under wine. Even if this
works for you currently, that is not a guarantee of future performance.

Until DirectX 11 support in wine is complete, there are several graphical glitches and the frame rate may
be horrible. Some of these issues are known and some are unknown.


1. Build Instructions

Compile wine as normal for shared WoW64 (https://wiki.winehq.org/Building_Wine#Shared_WoW64).

After running make install, you need to create a fake ntdll.dll. Assuming the default paths, you might run
the following commands:

$ cp ./tools/fixup_ntdll.tmpl ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32/ntdll.dll
$ ./tools/fixup_ntdll ../wine64-build/dlls/ntdll/ntdll.dll.so ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32/ntdll.dll 

The second command is generating trampolines to the real ntdll.dll functions. It will print out whichever
functions it couldn't handle properly. If everything is working, it will be a short list, such as:

__chkstk
DbgBreakPoint
DbgUserBreakPoint
LdrLoadDll
RtlAddVectoredExceptionHandler
RtlCaptureContext
RtlRaiseException


2. Running Overwatch

It is recommended that you download and run Overwatch using the Battle.net client.

When you run Overwatch, it is recommended that you disable fixme logging because there will be a lot of
error messages on your console otherwise. Run wine with a WINEDEBUG environment variable of "fixme-all":

$ WINEDEBUG=fixme-all ./wine 'c:\program files (x86)\battle.net\battle.net.exe'
